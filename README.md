# SQL-Hospital-Data-Analysis-Project.
This project focuses on analyzing hospital data using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. The dataset includes details such as patient records, doctor availability, admission/discharge dates, and medical expenses. Through SQL aggregation and filtering techniques, I was able to organize and analyze the data efficiently.

Key Features
1️⃣ Total Number of Patients – Computed the total number of patients across all hospitals.
2️⃣ Average Number of Doctors per Hospital – Retrieved the average number of doctors available in each hospital.
3️⃣ Top 3 Departments with the Highest Number of Patients – Identified the departments with the most patient visits.
4️⃣ Hospital with the Maximum Medical Expenses – Found the hospital that recorded the highest medical expenses.
5️⃣ Daily Average Medical Expenses – Calculated the average medical expenses incurred per day.
6️⃣ Longest Hospital Stay – Determined the patient with the longest stay by calculating the difference between the Discharge Date and Admission Date.
7️⃣ Total Patients Treated Per City – Counted the total number of patients treated in different cities.
8️⃣ Average Length of Stay Per Department – Analyzed the average number of days patients spent in each department.
9️⃣ Department with the Lowest Number of Patients – Identified the department with the least patient count.
🔟 Monthly Medical Expenses Report – Aggregated medical expenses by month for trend analysis.
